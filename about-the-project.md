# About the project

- This documentation guide is a Google Africa Developer Scholarship (2021) project made by the [MWS-030 learning phase 1 peer learning group, together with other interested learners and mentors from other peer learning groups](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/blob/main/contributor.md). Contributions are welcome from any GADS learner or mentor. The project is built to help in the following areas:


* Create a project gallery where learners can display projects made during GADS program.
* Encourage ourselves and GADS learners in subsequent years by the projects we make.
* Simulate a real world open source project or organisation where anyone is welcome to contribute.
* Practice use of Github, alongside other people and with no code writing involved.
* Have a real world and working portfolio project that can be presented anywhere.
