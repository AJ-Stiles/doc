## General instructions for making a video tutorial

* Tutorial must be beginner friendly
* Use a laptop preferably, not phone
* Audio must be audible
* Do not introduce yourself in the video, instead go straight to the point e.g. start with "Here's how to edit the GADS project gallery doc..."
* Do not show your face, just screen record
* Upload video to YouTube
* Embed the YouTube video on the **video tutorials** page
